PopCast
=============================================

In-game & in-editor recorder for unity
---------------------------------------------
+ [popcast.xyz](http://www.popcast.xyz)

Now Open Source
---------------------------------------------
+ This was previously a closed source project, but due to my limited time, development has slowed too much, so now it is open source
+ New releases, demos etc will appear here over time, but the current watermarked builds are at [the old release repository](https://github.com/NewChromantics/PopCast_Release/releases)
+ Pull requests are welcome.

Build instructions
---------------------------------------------
+ Will come shortly, but in general, open the project in visual studio, or xcode, and build.
